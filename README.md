# Grammar-and-Spell-Checker-Project
Grammar and Spell Checker
This project is a web-based application designed to identify and correct grammar and spelling errors in user-submitted text. The system is built using Python and integrates several libraries, including Flask for web development, TextBlob for natural language processing, and HTML for creating the front-end interface.

Key Features:

Grammar Checking: Analyzes the input text to detect common grammar mistakes such as subject-verb agreement, sentence structure, and punctuation errors.
Spell Checking: Automatically corrects misspelled words using the TextBlob libraryâ€™s in-built spell-checker.

User-Friendly Interface: The web interface, designed using HTML and Flask, allows users to easily input text and view the corrected output in real-time.

Custom Error Feedback: Provides specific feedback on the types of errors found, helping users improve their writing skills.

The project can be expanded to include additional language tools and a wider range of error types for more comprehensive text analysis.
